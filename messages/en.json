      "apiKeys": "What API keys do I need?",

      "credits": "How do credits work?",
      "creditsAnswer": "Each generation costs credits: Images cost 5 credits, Videos cost 20 credits, Voiceover lines cost 2 credits, and Scene generations cost 1 credit. New users start with 500 credits.",
      "slowMotion": "Why are my videos in slow motion?",
      "slowMotionAnswer": "Grok Imagine automatically determines movement speed based on your prompt. Add words like \"dynamic motion\", \"quick movement\", or \"energetic\" to your Image-to-Video prompts for faster motion.",
      "noDialogue": "Why is there no dialogue audio in my videos?",
      "noDialogueAnswer": "Grok Imagine generates ambient audio only, not dialogue. You need to add voiceover audio (from Step 5) to your videos in a video editor like CapCut. This gives you more control over timing.",
      "ownImages": "Can I use my own images?",
      "ownImagesAnswer": "Yes! You can upload your own images for characters or scenes. Click the upload area or drag-and-drop images. The app will still generate prompts for consistency.",
      "videoFormats": "What video formats are supported?",
      "videoFormatsAnswer": "Videos are generated as MP4 files at the same resolution as your input images. Duration is fixed at 6 seconds per clip. You can combine clips in CapCut or other editors.",
      "capcut": "How do I import into CapCut?",
      "capcutAnswer": "Export your project from Step 6, then import the videos and audio files into CapCut. Arrange them on the timeline according to the scene order. The export includes a timeline preview to help you organize.",
      "dataStorage": "Is my data stored online?",
      "dataStorageAnswer": "By default, all data is stored locally in your browser. API keys never leave your device. You can optionally sign in to enable cloud sync across devices.",
