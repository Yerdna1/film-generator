CHATGPT:
treba dat velky prompt napr tento:

Generate a complete creative package for a 12-scene 3D Animated Short Film (Style: High-quality Disney/Pixar 3D Render). Story Concept: "The Desert Search" — A young boy and his best friend (a furry purple monster) are driving their white delivery truck across a vast, hot desert. They are frantic, looking for their lost friend. INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONSISTENCY & SCALE: Define Characters Once: Use the Master Prompts below. CRITICAL CAMERA RULE: Do not generate wide landscape shots where characters are tiny. You must prioritize Medium Shots (waist up) and Close-ups (face focus) so the characters are large, detailed, and fill the frame. Step 1: Master Character Prompts Write two highly detailed Text-to-Image prompts to establish the look: [THE BOY]: (Write a detailed visual prompt for a 12-year-old boy in a Disney 3D style. He has a cute, expressive face, messy brown hair, and wears a blue delivery utility vest, shorts, and sneakers. He looks determined). [FUZZY]: (Write a detailed visual prompt for a cute, purple furry monster in a Disney 3D style. He has big expressive eyes, purple fur, and wears a matching blue delivery vest. He looks funny and lovable). Step 2: Scene Breakdown Generate the 12-scene script. For each scene, provide these two outputs: IMPORTANT: For every scene, specify "Medium Shot" or "Close-up" to keep characters large. (Text-to-Image Prompt): Describe the visual action. Start the prompt with "Medium Shot of..." or "Close up of..." ensuring The Boy and Fuzzy are large and clearly visible in the foreground. (Image-to-Video Prompt): Describe the movement and facial expressions. You must also include the character dialogue here.
